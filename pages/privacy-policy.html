            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
                cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you
                leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year. If you have an account and you log in to
                this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie
                contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in, we will also

            <h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>

            <p>
                Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
                content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
                and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the

            <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
            <p>
                If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
                recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
                queue. For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time
                (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that
                information.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use “cookies”, or similar electronic
                tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification
                (User ID) to understand the user’s individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you
                voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who
                you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain
                is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie
                cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser
                (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. Our web servers automatically collect
                limited information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when
                you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where
                to send you data — such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We
                use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests
                of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from
                where our visitors come.</p>
            <h2>Links to other sites</h2>
            <p>
                Our policy discloses the privacy practices for our own web site only. Our site provides links to other
                websites also that are beyond our control. We shall in no way be responsible in way for your use of such
                sites.
            </p>
            <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent of
                the user in the following limited circumstances: (a) When it is requested or required by law or by any
                court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or
                for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and
                punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is
                reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.
                (b) We proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such
                group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that
                these recipients of such information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in
                compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

                Information Security
            </h2>
            <p>
                We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,
                storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical
                security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All
                information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The database is
                stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly
                limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We
                cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not
                be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you
                include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. However the
                internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate
                necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with
                the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
